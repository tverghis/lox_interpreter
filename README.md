# lox_interpreter

This project is an implementation of a tree-walk interpreter of the Lox programming language. See the excellent [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book for more details.

I've tried to re-implement the Java-based interpreter from the aforementioned book in (as much as possible) idiomatic Rust.

`lox_interpreter` is still a work in progress.
